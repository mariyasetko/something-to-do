## Breif Overview
Welcome to "Something to Do!" This website was made with CSS and JavaScript in order to utilize both Ticketmaster's API and Google Maps Places API in order to find events in your area.

## How it works - Page 1
On the main page, you will be alerted with a search bar, use this search bar to enter an address that you wish to find events near.

## How it works - Page 2
On the second page after an address is typed in, it will show a google map with that area. If Ticketmaster has any events in your local area it will drop markers on the map and a list to the left will show up.
